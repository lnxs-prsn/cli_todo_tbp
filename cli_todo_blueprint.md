CLI Todo Project Blueprint
0. Research & Discovery
Knowledge gaps:

Python’s argparse/click for CLI interactions

File handling (JSON/text) for task persistence

Best practices for CLI UX (colors, help text)

References:

Python’s argparse/click documentation

Popular CLI todo apps (e.g., Taskwarrior) for inspiration

Validation:

Quick prototype: Can tasks be added/deleted via CLI?

1. Objective
Core functionality:

Add/delete/list tasks

Mark tasks as complete

Save tasks between sessions

Stretch goals:

Priority levels, due dates

Search/filter tasks

2. Success Criteria
Must-have:

Tasks persist after program exit

Basic CRUD operations work

Nice-to-have:

Colored output, help flags

Undo/error recovery

3. Phases & Steps
Setup

Single-file structure (todo.py)

Dependencies: argparse (or click), json for storage

Core Logic

Task storage: List of dictionaries (JSON file)

Functions: add_task(), delete_task(), list_tasks()

User Interaction

CLI commands: add "task name", done 1, list

Input validation: Handle missing/duplicate tasks

Extras & Robustness

Auto-create storage file if missing

Handle file corruption edge cases

4. Resources
Time: 3-5 hours (research + MVP)

Tools: Python 3.10+, argparse, json

Skills: Basic Python, file I/O

5. Risks & Mitigations
Risk: JSON file corruption → Fix: Backup file or switch to SQLite

Risk: Poor CLI UX → Fix: Use click for better help/colors
