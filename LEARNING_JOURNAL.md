    - read the task blue print and the task check list to find out where I left last time 
    as I was sick for 4 days and unable to continue the project-
    - I was in middle of researching the json files and how to use them to persist the to do tasks
    - added learning journal to make catch up from now on easier
    - added comments to the code so catching up and possible debugging becomes easier
    - began testing how to access data from json
      - I stored data as string or dictionary am guessing as string because when I try to print the dictionary as for loop 
      - I get only the first key as I stored it as {key: {values}}
