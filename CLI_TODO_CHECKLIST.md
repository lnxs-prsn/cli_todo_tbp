You were right — sorry about changing names earlier. I’ll keep your exact stage headings and phrasing.
Below is a **simple, beginner-friendly checklist** covering every stage **0. Research & Discovery → 5. Risks & Mitigations**, with short Backup / Panic actions where helpful so you keep momentum.

---

## 0. Research & Discovery

* **Knowledge gaps —** Read short docs/examples for:

  * `argparse` **or** `click` (how to parse CLI args).

    * Backup: Make a 2-line pros/cons note.
    * Panic: Watch a 5-minute intro video to either one.
  * File handling (write/read JSON or text).

    * Backup: Copy one simple JSON read/write snippet.
    * Panic: Open Python REPL and `import json; print(json.dumps({"a":1}))`.
  * Basic CLI UX (help text, minimal colors).

    * Backup: Look at one README for CLI usage examples.
    * Panic: Jot down 2 example commands (`add`, `list`).
* **References —** Open:

  * `argparse`/`click` docs, and one or two simple todo-CLI GitHub READMEs (e.g., Taskwarrior for inspiration).

    * Backup: Bookmark the docs.
    * Panic: Save one README URL in a notes file.
* **Validation —** Quick prototype:

  * Make a 5–15 minute script that adds one task and reads it back from file.

    * Backup: Write pseudocode describing the steps.
    * Panic: Run `print("todo prototype")` in REPL to unblock momentum.

---

## 1. Objective

* **Core functionality —** Decide and write down MVP features:

  * `add`, `delete`, `list`, `done` (mark complete), persistent storage.

    * Backup: Narrow MVP to `add` + `list` only for first pass.
    * Panic: Choose one command (`add`) to start.
* **Stretch goals —** Note extras to add later:

  * Priority, due dates, search/filter.

    * Backup: Put stretch goals into a `later` section in README.
    * Panic: Write them as single-line todo notes.

---

## 2. Success Criteria

* **Must-have:** List the hard pass/fail checks:

  * Tasks persist after program exit.
  * Basic CRUD (create/list/update/delete) works.

    * Backup: Manually save file after actions until auto-save is implemented.
    * Panic: Record failing case in notes and move on.
* **Nice-to-have:** Optional improvements:

  * Colored output, helpful `--help`, undo support.

    * Backup: Mark these as “v1.1” items.
    * Panic: Skip and keep MVP small.

---

## 3. Phases & Steps

**A. Setup**

* [ ] Create single-file `todo.py`.

  * Backup: Create `todo.txt` placeholder.
  * Panic: Open editor and create an empty file.
* [ ] Choose CLI library (`argparse` or `click`) and note dependencies.

  * Backup: Use `argparse` (no install).
  * Panic: Use simple `sys.argv` parsing.

**B. Core Logic**

* [ ] Design task storage model (list of dicts with `id`, `description`, `done`, optional `priority`, `due`).

  * Backup: Start with `id`, `description`, `done`.
  * Panic: Use plain list of strings temporarily.
* [ ] Implement `load_tasks()` (reads JSON, returns list).

  * Backup: Implement header + docstring only.
  * Panic: Hardcode return of an example list.
* [ ] Implement `save_tasks()` (writes JSON; create `.bak` on save).

  * Backup: Just print “saving…” in function.
  * Panic: Leave TODO comment to implement.
* [ ] Implement `add_task(description)` — add in-memory and save.

  * Backup: Append to in-memory list only.
  * Panic: Write function name + docstring.
* [ ] Implement `list_tasks()` — print id, status, description.

  * Backup: Print a hardcoded sample.
  * Panic: Print “no tasks yet”.
* [ ] Implement `mark_task_done(task_id)` and `delete_task(task_id)`.

  * Backup: Print simulated action.
  * Panic: Add placeholder function with docstring.

**C. User Interaction**

* [ ] Wire CLI commands: `add "task"`, `list`, `done <id>`, `delete <id>`.

  * Backup: Implement `list` only first.
  * Panic: Make CLI print usage examples.
* [ ] Add input validation (missing args, non-numeric ids).

  * Backup: Validate only for obvious cases.
  * Panic: Print friendly error and continue.
* [ ] Add helpful `--help` text / examples in README.

  * Backup: Provide one usage example in README.
  * Panic: Print a short help message in code.

**D. Extras & Robustness**

* [ ] Auto-create `tasks.json` if missing.

  * Backup: Add instruction in README to create file manually.
  * Panic: Program prints “create tasks.json” and exits gracefully.
* [ ] Handle corrupted JSON (restore from `.bak` or warn user).

  * Backup: Detect parse error and rename corrupted file before exiting.
  * Panic: Print clear recovery steps in error message.
* [ ] Add lightweight UX polish (simple status tags, optional color lib later).

  * Backup: Use uppercase tags like `[DONE]`.
  * Panic: Plain text output only.

## 4. Resources

* **Time:** Plan \~3–5 hours for research + MVP.

  * Backup: Break into 30–60 minute sessions.
  * Panic: Do a 15–20 minute microtask (write one function header).
* **Tools:** Python 3.10+, text editor (VS Code, etc.), `argparse` or `click`, `json`.

  * Backup: Use system Python + simple editor.
  * Panic: Use an online REPL to test tiny snippets.
* **Skills:** Basic Python, file I/O, simple CLI parsing.

  * Backup: Follow one tutorial for each small gap.
  * Panic: Watch a targeted 5–10 minute tutorial.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk:** JSON file corruption or accidental data loss.

  * Mitigation: Save `.bak` of `tasks.json` on each save; keep last-good copy.
  * Backup action (momentum): If worried, manually copy `tasks.json` to `tasks.json.bak` before major edits.
  * Panic action: Restore from `tasks.json.bak` and note the failure in README.
* **Risk:** Poor CLI UX (confusing commands, hard-to-use).

  * Mitigation: Keep commands minimal and consistent; add clear `--help` examples.
  * Backup action: Start with the simplest commands (`add`, `list`) and expand later.
  * Panic action: Revert to README examples and demo usage in terminal.
* **Risk:** Overwhelm / procrastination slowing progress.

  * Mitigation: Keep MVP tiny; break tasks into <60-minute chunks; use Backup/Panic micro-tasks to keep momentum.
  * Backup action: If a main step is too big, do a smaller related task (write pseudocode, update README).
  * Panic action: Spend 5 minutes reading a short tutorial or watching a 5-minute video to keep the habit alive.
* **Risk:** Picking the wrong storage format early (JSON vs SQLite).

  * Mitigation: Start with JSON for MVP, design code so storage layer can be swapped later.
  * Backup action: Keep storage functions small and isolated.
  * Panic action: Note the decision in README and continue — refactor later if needed.

If you want, I can now:

* Turn this into a **printable one-page checklist** (compact), or
* Create a **timeboxed plan** that maps these checklist items into 4 coding sessions (what to do each 45–60 min block).

Which would help you start right away?
